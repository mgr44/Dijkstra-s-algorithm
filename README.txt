Michael Ritchie's Dijkstra's algorithm program

This was a student assignment and is posted here as a coding sample. If you are a student do not
use this work without citing me as the author. 

I was responsible for coding the files GraphM.h and .cpp, as well as GraphL.h and .cpp. The
other files were provided to me by my instructor, these include the Node.h and .cpp files, the data.txt
files, and the Lab3.cpp driver file.

This project was made to be compiled and run in linux using the standard g++ compiler. Data is read in
from the data.txt files to cunstruct the graph. The results are outputed to the console through 
cout.
